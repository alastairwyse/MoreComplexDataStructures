      <summary>
        Returns a non-negative random integer that is less than the specified maximum.

      <param name="maxValue">The exclusive upper bound of the random number to be generated. maxValue must be greater than or equal to 0.</param>
      <returns>A 32-bit signed integer that is greater than or equal to 0, and less than maxValue; that is, the range of return values ordinarily includes 0 but not maxValue. However, if maxValue equals 0, maxValue is returned.</returns>
